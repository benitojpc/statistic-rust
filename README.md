Statistic with Rust

Essential Rust Libraries for Statistics:

* **ndarray**, it's a versatile and powerful crate for handling n-dimensional arrays in Rust, it is inspired by *NumPy* and provides similar functionality.
  * support multi-dimensional arrays with shape and strides.
  * efficient operations: element-wise, broadcasting, and linear algebra operations.
  * various array manipulation methods: slicing, stacking, reshaping, and concatenation.
  * interoperability with BLAS and LAPACK libraries for high-performance linear algegra computations.
* **statrs**, a comprehensive statistics library for Rust that provides a wide range of statistical functions, probability distributions, and other mathematical tools. Features:
  * support for common probability distributions, such as: Normal, Poisson, Bernoulli, and more.
  * various descriptive statistics functions like: mean, variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
  * Hypothesis testing functions, such as *t-test, chi-square, and F-test*.
  * Correlation and regression analysis functions.
* **statis**, library focused on providing efficient implementations of statistical algorithms and data structures in Rust. While not as acomprehensive as *statrs*, *statis* offers a more focused set of tools for specific statistical tasks. Features:
  * Data structures for handling histograms, frecuency tables, and probability mass functions.
  * Support for basic descriptive statistics, such as: mean, median, mode, and standard variation.
  * Efficient implementation of various statistical algorithms: order statistics, kernel density estimation, and k-means clustering.
* **plotly** is a popular library for creating interactive and visually plots in various programming languages. The *plotly* can be rendered in a web browser or saved to a file. Features:
  * Support for various plot types: scatter, line, bar, pie, and more.
  * Customizalbe plot aesthetics, such as colors, markers, and axis labels.
  * Interactive plot features, including zooming, panning, and hover tooltips.
  * Ability to save plots as: HTML, SVG, or PNG files.
